<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>OJP Enhanced brings back some of the classic game modes found in Jedi Knight:
Outcast.&nbsp; In addition to the standard multiplayer game modes, you can also
play:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><h1>Capture the Ysalamari</h1>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>CTF with a twist!&nbsp; The flags now have the object properties of the
Ysalamari.&nbsp; When you hold the flag,&nbsp; you cannot use Force powers...and
none can be used against you!&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li>
<h1>Holocron FFA</h1>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This mode is identical to normal Deathmatch (FFA) except that throughout the
levels there are Holocron cubes. Force Enlightenment Holocrons are removed in
this mode.&nbsp; Unlike in a normal FFA game, every player starts with just
Level 1 Force Jump, Level 1 Saber Attack, and no other Force Powers. His Force
configuration screen is also disabled, since Force Powers are acquired through
Holocrons, not Force Point Allocation.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<h1>Jedi Master</h1>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The game itself is much like the old schoolyard game of “tag.”&nbsp; Each
match begins like a normal Deathmatch, except that no player has any Force
(except for Level 1 Force Jump) or a lightsaber. Thus players are limited to the
Stun Baton, Bryar Pistol and whatever guns/explosive and gadgets they can pick
up and use.&nbsp; Players cannot harm one another (though they could
theoretically blast each other off ledges) in this state. Essentially they are
all on the same “team.”</p>
<p>There is one lightsaber in the level (that always respawns in the same place)
which glows gold through walls. Once picked up, this player becomes the Jedi
Master. As the JM, he receives 200 health (total) and all of the Force Powers at
their highest levels (except for Absorb and Drain) while some music plays. The
JM glows blue (through walls) to all non-force players. His 200 health count
down until it reaches 100, and then it functions as normal. He loses access to
all his weapons (minus the saber) but his items and shields remain as before.</p>
<p>Now the rest of the players are able to kill him. He scores points by killing
the non-force players. The JM’s only weapon is his lightsaber (and the Force)
and any items he can pick up.</p>
<p>Only the JM may score, thus it’s a race for the lightsaber and who can hold
onto it and get the most kills. The non-force players may work together to kill
the JM, but after that, it’s every person for himself!</p>
