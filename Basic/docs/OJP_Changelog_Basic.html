    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expanded IP
Banlist</span> - The IP banlist now uses an externally stored
file
(banip.txt) to ban certain IP addresses from the server.&nbsp; You
can use
incomplete IPs (IE 192.246.40) to ban entire subnets.&nbsp; Use the

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">BugFix2 </span>-
Fixes a major issue with the animation timer calculation in

  <ul>

feature.</li>




  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">More Vehicles</span>
- The game code has been changed to up the vehicle limit
from 16 to 64 different vehicle files.&nbsp; This means you can
have 64
different types of vehicle models (You can spawn up to 128 vehicles
total.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>




  
  
  
  <ul>




    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp;
Different vehicle skins count against the vehicle model
total. &nbsp;In addition, the vehicle weapon limit has been raised
from 16 to 64.</li>




  
  
  
  </ul>

the
weapons for that ammo type are disabled.&nbsp; You now have menu
options for
Melee Only, Sabers &amp; Melee Only, and No Explosives.</li>

  <ul>




    
    
    
    <ul>




      <li>Added holocron points for all JKA FFA maps in the form

  </ul>




  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">RGB Sabers
(RGBSabers)</span> - The creator of the very well known RGB
sabers for JK2,
Tchouky, has exclusively given OJP his RGB sabers code for
JKA.&nbsp; It's
been greatly improved over his JK2 version and now supports a black
cored saber, RGB sabers, "Pimp" sabers (a saber that randomly shifts
colors), a powerful RGB saber scripting system (so you can have your
saber shift colors to your liking), full bot support for the system,
and easy to use menus.</li>




  
  
  
  <ul>




    <li>For those that don't know what RGB Sabers are, it simply
means that you
can choose your saber color from over 16 million unique colors (by
using a 24 bit RGB scale).</li>




  
  
  
  </ul>




  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">True View
(TrueView) </span>- True View is a realistic first person view
for all weapons
(including melee mode) that allows you to play the game from inside
your character.&nbsp; Roll and you'll see your body roll.&nbsp;
Look down and
you'll see your feet.&nbsp; True View adds multiple options to the
game so
be sure to check the cvar list and readme for details on how to get the
most from True View.</li>




  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Various Code

animation.</li>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId517875"></a>Improvements</h3>
