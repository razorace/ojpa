<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId321284"></a>Introduction</h2>The
Open Jedi Project is a open source project dedicated to improving Jedi
Knight Academy. &nbsp;Our primary work is on OJP Basic and OJP Enhanced, but
we also have skins and vehicle packs.<br><br>OJP Basic contains general bug fixes and non-gameplay altering enhancements.<br><br>OJP Enhanced goes beyond OJP Basic by radically changing JKA to present a more movie-like experience.<br><br>Check out the <a href="Features"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Features</span></a> section to learn more about what OJP has done.<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId294339"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Known Bugs</span></h2>This section covers known bugs that OJP can't fix or have workarounds. &nbsp;We have a complete list of OJP bugs on our <a href="http://www.lucasforums.com/showthread.php?t=171234">online bug tracker</a>. &nbsp;If you find a bug we've missed, please <a href="http://www.lucasforums.com/showthread.php?t=171234">report it</a>.<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId707139"></a>Basic</h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Issue:</span>&nbsp; When the map is loading for a Capture the Ysalamiri game, the load screen says that we're playing Capture the Flag.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Solution:</span>&nbsp; This isn't really a bug as it's caused by running OJP
Basic without the client component.&nbsp; If you wish to fix the problem,
download and install OJP Basic.<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId814879"></a>Skins</h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Issue:</span>&nbsp; In the Hoth mission of the single player campaign, my Hoth outfit loses its color selection abilities! <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Solution:</span>&nbsp; This is because the Hoth cold suit that is selectable in
the menu is a slightly modified version of the original Hoth skin. The
Hoth maps use the originals, so you're basically stuck with this issue
unless you activate cheat mode and manually switch back to the
selectable Hoth.<br><h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId486486"></a>Want to Help? &nbsp;Here's How!</h2>If you're interested in helping OJP, just contact us on <a href="http://www.lucasforums.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=542">our forums</a>.
